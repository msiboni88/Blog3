## Nailed It! Contestant Analysis

This is the code I used behind my blog post, [Would I embarrass myself if I went on Netflixâ€™s *Nailed It?*](https://medium.com/swlh/would-i-embarrass-myself-if-i-went-on-netflixs-nailed-it-9e3ae8ff6b5a)

The goal of this post was to create a classification model that could predict whether or not an individual (primarily myself) would embarrass themselves on the show. I manually compiled data from every episode of *Nailed It!*; however, because I was making quick guesses and judgements about strangers, I have decided NOT to share the data behind this model. 

I will, however, share the data dictionary for the relevant variables to my model : 
#### Data Dictionary

|southwest|int|df|Contestant lives in the Southwest (Yes = 1, No =0)|
|west|int|df|Contestant lives in the West (Yes = 1, No =0)|

I input the following variables to determine my own results: 
```
me = {'baking_experience' : 0, 
      'decorating_experience' : 1, 
      'goofy' : 1, 
      'here_to_impress_someone' : 1,
      'just_married' : 0, 
      'risk_taker' : 1,
      'familiar_with_show' : 1, 
      'here_for_the_money' : 0, 
      'slow' : 1, 
      'female' : 1, 
      'male' : 0,
      'middle_aged' : 0, 
      'older' : 0, 
      'young' : 1, 
      'arts' : 0, 
      'design' : 0,
      'entertainment_&_tourism' : 0, 
      'healthcare' : 0, 
      'law_enforcement' : 0, 
      'military' : 0,
      'parent' : 0, 
      'sales' : 0, 
      'social_media' : 0, 
      'student' : 0, 
      'tech' : 1, 
      'midwest' : 0,
      'northeast' : 0,
      'southeast' : 0, 
      'southwest' : 0, 
      'west': 1}
```
## Next Steps
- With more time, I would have loved to dig in to the ROC curve of my logistic regression model to look for ways to optimize for accuracy and sensitivty (as I would not want to get a false negative and be lulled into a sense of security by that.
- I would like to build a web app that can tell someone else whether or not they would embarrass themselves. 
- I would create models for whether or not a person is likely to win an episode.
